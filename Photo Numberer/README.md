# PhotoNumberer

You can use this software for contiguesly number photos. 
Photos should renamed with number order (ex: 1 to 50) and photos should be in jpg extention.
You can simply enter your number range and customize properties simply.
Then you can get a folder named converted and you can easiy get numbered photos from it.
Also you can devide photoes into (2,3 or more) folders and after deviding them they are in the folder called processed.
"report.txt" shows the errors in whole program.
This is a simple software that I developed for myself & this software helped me for doing some jobs very easily. If you like this you can use this.
THANK YOU.
